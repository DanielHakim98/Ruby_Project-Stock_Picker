* Third project with Ruby programming. This is gonna be challenging.
* The main function of this programming is passing an argument of array with a list of price from day 0 and then return back an array with buy day and sell day with the most profit.

* It is indeed challenging but finally I solved it by using common programming conditional and loops.
* One thing could be improved if the code is shorten by being true 'Rubbyist' (using available enumeralble methods).
